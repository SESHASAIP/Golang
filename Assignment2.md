### Difference Between Unsigned Int and Signed Int?<br>
Usigned Int: In the usigned int we can only store the positive values (0 to max range ).The maximun range of value we can store depends on .Which kind of the int we are choosing like uint16,uint32&uint64.<br>
Signed Int: In signed int we don't have any restriction to store .We can store the -ve and +ve values as well.<br>
### Difference between Go and Java?<br>
Go: Java needs the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to interpret compiled code. Go simply compiles the code into a binary file for any given platform.Java has multithreading capabilities that make for a similar effect, but in Java, this feature is far more primitive than in Go<br>
### Difference between Go and Python?<br>
Go is a Procedural, functional and concurrent language while Python is an object-oriented, imperative, functional, and procedural language. Go supports concurrency, on the other hand Python, doesn't have any in-built concurrency mechanism<br>
### Advantages of Go:?<br>
Faster execution<br>
Active developer community<br>
Comprehensive tool<br>
Scalable<br>
Easy to learn<b>

### Disadvantages of Go?<br>
It's a relatively new language with not many libraries or information.
Its simplicity seems superficial because of its internal inconsistencies.
With limited scope, automation can invite errors.
It's got defective dependency management.
It's a high-level language with low-level features.<br>
